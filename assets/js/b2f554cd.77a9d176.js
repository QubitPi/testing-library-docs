I\'m pleased to announce the recent updates to the testing-library\\nfamily of tools! As always, we\'re committed to giving you the best tools to\\nenable you to have confidence in shipping your applications. That\'s why the\\nguiding principle for everything we do is:\\n\\n> [The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/977018512689455106)\\n\\nThis guiding principle has given us direction and we\'ve been able to accomplish\\na lot in the testing space. To further our mission, I\'d like to make a few\\nannouncements about changes going on in the testing-library world.\\n\\n## [dom-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library) v4 released!\\n\\nThis is actually a pretty small release, but I think it\'s worth mentioning\\nanyway. We try to keep breaking changes to a minimum. This release only has two\\nbreaking changes. One is removal of deprecated methods you probably weren\'t\\nusing anyway, and the other reveals potential bugs in your tests. So you should\\nbe able to upgrade to this version with little-to-no effort.\\n\\nIf you do experience breakages, it\'s probably due to something like this:\\n\\n\x3c!-- prettier in my editor treats this like MDX, which turns this into a\\nself-closing tag. But the parser docusaurus uses doesn\'t like that so we\'ll\\njust disable it here --\x3e\\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore --\x3e\\n<iframe\\n  src=\\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/9zw1wv59mw?fontsize=14&module=%2Fsrc%2F__tests__%2Findex.js&previewwindow=tests&view=editor\\"\\n  title=\\"React Codesandbox\\"\\n  style={{width: \'100%\', height:500, border:0, borderRadius: 4, overflow:\'hidden\'}}   sandbox=\\"allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin\\"\\n></iframe>\\n\\nWe hope that this helps you catch bugs better!\\n\\n[react-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)\\nand\\n[cypress-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/cypress-testing-library)\\nhave already been updated and released major version bumps of their own to\\naccount for this upgrade. Other wrappers will hopefully follow shortly based on\\ntheir respective matinainers\' schedules.\\n\\n> [View the Changelog](https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library/releases/tag/v4.0.0)\\n\\n## [Testing Library on GitHub](https://github.com/testing-library)\\n\\nWe\'ve created a new org on GitHub to manage the family of testing library\\nprojects. The best part of the \\"Testing Library\\" isn\'t the code, but the\\nphilosophy behind it. So we\'re using the organization as a way to group all the\\nprojects that share the same philosophy and general utilities so whether you\'re\\nusing Vue, Cypress, or React (Native), you\'ll have a super testing tool that\\nyou\'re familiar with.\\n\\nHere are the current (or soon to be) members of the org:\\n\\n- [dom-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library)\\n- [react-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)\\n- [cypress-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/cypress-testing-library)\\n- [vue-testing-library](https://github.com/dfcook/vue-testing-library)\\n- [native-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/native-testing-library)\\n  (React Native)\\n- [pptr-testing-library](https://github.com/patrickhulce/pptr-testing-library)\\n  (Puppeteer)\\n- [bs-react-testing-library](https://github.com/wyze/bs-react-testing-library)\\n  (ReasonReact)\\n- [testcafe-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/testcafe-testing-library)\\n- [user-event](https://github.com/Gpx/user-event)\\n- [jest-dom](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom)\\n- [jest-native](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-native)\\n\\n(Hopefully we\'ll have\\n[angular on there eventually](https://github.com/angular-extensions/testing-library/issues/4)\\n[as well as ember](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/327)).\\n\\nWhat\'s cool is that building wrappers for your JavaScript framework of choice is\\noften quite simple (as I demonstrate on\\n[TestingJavaScript.com](https://testingjavascript.com)). And as mentioned below,\\nyou can carry these same principles to non-DOM platforms as well!\\n\\n> [Checkout the Org and Star our Repos](https://github.com/testing-library)\\n\\n## [Testing Library on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/testing-library)\\n\\nIf the Testing Library family of tools has provided you any value at all, we\'d\\nencourage you (or your employer) to contribute to our new\\n[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/testing-library).\\n\\nIt is intended that funds raised by this open collective be used to:\\n\\n- Donate to charities and other good causes\\n- Purchase testing-library related merchandise (stickers, T-Shirts, etc).\\n- Pay for hosting/domains/etc.\\n\\nThere are currently no plans to pay people who work on the project, but we\\nreserve the right to do so if it makes sense in the future.\\n\\n> [Contribute to our open collective](https://opencollective.com/testing-library)\\n\\n## [Testing Library on Twitter](https://twitter.com/testinglib)\\n\\nA lot of chatter is going on in the Testing Library world on Twitter, so we\'ve\\ncreated a twitter account you can follow and keep up with what\'s going on.\\n\\n> [Follow @TestingLib](https://twitter.com/testinglib)\\n\\n## [Testing Library on Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/testing-library)\\n\\nWe\'ve had a pretty active spectrum community for react-testing-library. We\'re in\\nthe process of moving that to a more general Testing Library spectrum so we can\\nhave all discussion around the different wrappers in one place. There are over\\n600 members of our spectrum community (special shout-out to\\n[Giorgio](https://spectrum.chat/users/gpx) who has been SUPER helpful to people\\nthere.) Please join us!\\n\\n> [Join us on Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/testing-library)\\n\\n## [Testing Library on React Native](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/)\\n\\nI\'m really happy to announce a super solution to the React Native testing space.\\nThe DOM is quite different from native, as I mentioned before, it\'s not the code\\nbut the concepts that really make the Testing Library great. I\'m happy to say\\nthat [Brandon Carroll](https://github.com/bcarroll22) has successfully ported\\nthose concepts to a solution for React Native and I\'m really happy with it. Give\\nit a look if you\'re building React Native applications and want confidence that\\nthey continue to work as you make changes!\\n\\n> [Checkout native-testing-library](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/)\\n\\n## [Learn Testing Library](/docs/learning)\\n\\nThere\'s been a LOT of activity around the Testing Library principles and tools\\nin the content space. We do have\\n[a page that lists learning materials](/docs/learning), and more gets added to\\nit daily. If you know of blog posts, YouTube videos, courses, or anything else\\nabout the Testing Library family of tools, please contribute to the list!\\n\\n> [Contribute to the learning materials page](https://github.com/testing-library/testing-library-docs/edit/main/docs/learning.mdx)\\n\\n## Other Exciting news\\n\\nAs of a few months ago,\\n[the React team officially recommends](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html)\\nyou use react-testing-library to test your react applications. That\'s kinda neat\\n:)\\n\\nAt the React Amsterdam [Open Source awards](https://osawards.com/react/)\\nceremony, react-testing-library won the award for the Most impactful\\ncontribution to the community!\\n\\n![Open Source Awards award](/img/blog/award.jpg)\\n\\nreact-testing-library _also_ received recognition on the\\n[ThoughtWorks Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks)\\nas technology they believe is \\"Worth exploring with the goal of understanding\\nhow it will affect your enterprise.\\" We think so too :)\\n\\n## Special Thank You\\n\\nEach of the projects has had many contributors and on most projects in\\n[the org](https://github.com/testing-library), you\'ll find a table of\\ncontributors. We\'re super grateful for all the contributions people have made to\\nthe projects. I\'d like to also give a special shout-out to people who have made\\nan especially significant impact on the Testing Library family of tools and\\ncommunity.\\n\\n[Myself \ud83d\udc4b](https://kentcdodds.com), [Alex Krolick](https://alexkrolick.com/),\\n[Brandon Carroll](https://github.com/bcarroll22),\\n[Giorgio](https://twitter.com/Gpx),\\n[Ernesto Garc\xeda](https://twitter.com/gnapse), and\\n[Daniel Cook](https://github.com/dfcook).\\n\\nAs I said, there have been many who have contributed a great deal to the\\ncommunity, but these people stand out to me as individuals who have done\\nespecially great work. Thank you!\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nNo matter what platform you\'re working with, the guiding principles of the\\nTesting Library family can be applied to the tests for that platform. Take a\\nstep back and consider how closely your tests are resembling the way your\\nsoftware is used. If you can, consider what lightweight but powerful utilities\\nwould enable others to test their software in that way as well and create a\\nlibrary for that! Maybe it can join the Testing Library family of tools!"},{"id":"/2019/03/17/code-blocks","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2019/03/17/code-blocks","source":"@site/blog/2019-03-17-code-blocks.mdx","title":"Multi-Framework Code Blocks","description":"Many of the code samples have been updated to include tabs to switch between","date":"2019-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 17, 2019","tags":[],"readingTime":0.3,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Krolick","url":"http://github.com/alexkrolick"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Multi-Framework Code Blocks","author":"Alex Krolick","authorURL":"http://github.com/alexkrolick"},"prevItem":{"title":"Testing Library Updates: new release, github org, open collective, and twitter account","permalink":"/blog/2019/04/25/new-org"},"nextItem":{"title":"New Site","permalink":"/blog/2018/12/29/new-site"}},"content":"Many of the code samples have been updated to include tabs to switch between\\n\\"plain\\" DOM Testing Library syntax and the wrappers for React, Cypress, etc.\\n\\nThanks to [@tylerthehaas](https://github.com/tylerthehaas) for pointing out that\\nthe previous examples could be confusing if you were targeting a specific\\nlibrary, and to the Docusaurus team for adding support for code tabs in version\\n[1.7.2](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#170---2019-1-23)."},{"id":"/2018/12/29/new-site","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2018/12/29/new-site","source":"@site/blog/2018-12-29-new-site.mdx","title":"New Site","description":"We have a docs site now!
