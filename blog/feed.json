            "content_html": "<p>Hello friends! I'm pleased to announce the recent updates to the testing-library\nfamily of tools! As always, we're committed to giving you the best tools to\nenable you to have confidence in shipping your applications. That's why the\nguiding principle for everything we do is:</p><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/977018512689455106\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.</a></p></blockquote><p>This guiding principle has given us direction and we've been able to accomplish\na lot in the testing space. To further our mission, I'd like to make a few\nannouncements about changes going on in the testing-library world.</p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"dom-testing-library-v4-released\"><a href=\"https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dom-testing-library</a> v4 released!<a class=\"hash-link\" href=\"#dom-testing-library-v4-released\" title=\"Direct link to heading\">​</a></h2><p>This is actually a pretty small release, but I think it's worth mentioning\nanyway. We try to keep breaking changes to a minimum. This release only has two\nbreaking changes. One is removal of deprecated methods you probably weren't\nusing anyway, and the other reveals potential bugs in your tests. So you should\nbe able to upgrade to this version with little-to-no effort.</p><p>If you do experience breakages, it's probably due to something like this:</p><iframe src=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/9zw1wv59mw?fontsize=14&amp;module=%2Fsrc%2F__tests__%2Findex.js&amp;previewwindow=tests&amp;view=editor\" title=\"React Codesandbox\" style=\"width:100%;height:500px;border:0;border-radius:4px;overflow:hidden\" sandbox=\"allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin\"></iframe><p>We hope that this helps you catch bugs better!</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">react-testing-library</a>\nand\n<a href=\"https://github.com/testing-library/cypress-testing-library\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cypress-testing-library</a>\nhave already been updated and released major version bumps of their own to\naccount for this upgrade. Other wrappers will hopefully follow shortly based on\ntheir respective matinainers' schedules.</p><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library/releases/tag/v4.0.0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">View the Changelog</a></p></blockquote><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"testing-library-on-github\"><a href=\"https://github.com/testing-library\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Testing Library on GitHub</a><a class=\"hash-link\" href=\"#testing-library-on-github\" title=\"Direct link to heading\">​</a></h2><p>We've created a new org on GitHub to manage the family of testing library\nprojects. The best part of the \"Testing Library\" isn't the code, but the\nphilosophy behind it. So we're using the organization as a way to group all the\nprojects that share the same philosophy and general utilities so whether you're\nusing Vue, Cypress, or React (Native), you'll have a super testing tool that\nyou're familiar with.</p><p>Here are the current (or soon to be) members of the org:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dom-testing-library</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">react-testing-library</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/testing-library/cypress-testing-library\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cypress-testing-library</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/dfcook/vue-testing-library\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vue-testing-library</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/testing-library/native-testing-library\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">native-testing-library</a>\n(React Native)</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/patrickhulce/pptr-testing-library\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pptr-testing-library</a>\n(Puppeteer)</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/wyze/bs-react-testing-library\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bs-react-testing-library</a>\n(ReasonReact)</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/testing-library/testcafe-testing-library\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">testcafe-testing-library</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/Gpx/user-event\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">user-event</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">jest-dom</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/testing-library/jest-native\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">jest-native</a></li></ul><p>(Hopefully we'll have\n<a href=\"https://github.com/angular-extensions/testing-library/issues/4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">angular on there eventually</a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/327\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">as well as ember</a>).</p><p>What's cool is that building wrappers for your JavaScript framework of choice is\noften quite simple (as I demonstrate on\n<a href=\"https://testingjavascript.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TestingJavaScript.com</a>).

Take a\nstep back and consider how closely your tests are resembling the way your\nsoftware is used. If you can, consider what lightweight but powerful utilities\nwould enable others to test their software in that way as well and create a\nlibrary for that! Maybe it can join the Testing Library family of tools!</p>",
