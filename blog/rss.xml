            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello friends! I'm pleased to announce the recent updates to the testing-library
family of tools! As always, we're committed to giving you the best tools to
enable you to have confidence in shipping your applications. That's why the
guiding principle for everything we do is:</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/977018512689455106" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.</a></p></blockquote><p>This guiding principle has given us direction and we've been able to accomplish
a lot in the testing space. To further our mission, I'd like to make a few
announcements about changes going on in the testing-library world.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dom-testing-library-v4-released"><a href="https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dom-testing-library</a> v4 released!<a class="hash-link" href="#dom-testing-library-v4-released" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>This is actually a pretty small release, but I think it's worth mentioning
anyway. We try to keep breaking changes to a minimum. This release only has two
breaking changes. One is removal of deprecated methods you probably weren't
using anyway, and the other reveals potential bugs in your tests. So you should
be able to upgrade to this version with little-to-no effort.</p><p>If you do experience breakages, it's probably due to something like this:</p><iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/9zw1wv59mw?fontsize=14&amp;module=%2Fsrc%2F__tests__%2Findex.js&amp;previewwindow=tests&amp;view=editor" title="React Codesandbox" style="width:100%;height:500px;border:0;border-radius:4px;overflow:hidden" sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe><p>We hope that this helps you catch bugs better!</p><p><a href="https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">react-testing-library</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/testing-library/cypress-testing-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cypress-testing-library</a>
have already been updated and released major version bumps of their own to
account for this upgrade. Other wrappers will hopefully follow shortly based on
their respective matinainers' schedules.</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library/releases/tag/v4.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View the Changelog</a></p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="testing-library-on-github"><a href="https://github.com/testing-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing Library on GitHub</a><a class="hash-link" href="#testing-library-on-github" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>We've created a new org on GitHub to manage the family of testing library
projects. The best part of the "Testing Library" isn't the code, but the
philosophy behind it. So we're using the organization as a way to group all the
projects that share the same philosophy and general utilities so whether you're
using Vue, Cypress, or React (Native), you'll have a super testing tool that
you're familiar with.</p><p>Here are the current (or soon to be) members of the org:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dom-testing-library</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">react-testing-library</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/testing-library/cypress-testing-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cypress-testing-library</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/dfcook/vue-testing-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vue-testing-library</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/testing-library/native-testing-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">native-testing-library</a>

<a href="https://github.com/angular-extensions/testing-library/issues/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">angular on there eventually</a>
<a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as well as ember</a>).</p><p>What's cool is that building wrappers for your JavaScript framework of choice is
often quite simple (as I demonstrate on
<a href="https://testingjavascript.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestingJavaScript.com</a>). And as mentioned below,
you can carry these same principles to non-DOM platforms as well!</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://github.com/testing-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Checkout the Org and Star our Repos</a></p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="testing-library-on-open-collective"><a href="https://opencollective.com/testing-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing Library on Open Collective</a><a class="hash-link" href="#testing-library-on-open-collective" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>If the Testing Library family of tools has provided you any value at all, we'd
encourage you (or your employer) to contribute to our new
<a href="https://opencollective.com/testing-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Collective</a>.</p><p>It is intended that funds raised by this open collective be used to:</p><ul><li>Donate to charities and other good causes</li><li>Purchase testing-library related merchandise (stickers, T-Shirts, etc).</li><li>Pay for hosting/domains/etc.</li></ul><p>There are currently no plans to pay people who work on the project, but we
reserve the right to do so if it makes sense in the future.</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://opencollective.com/testing-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contribute to our open collective</a></p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="testing-library-on-twitter"><a href="https://twitter.com/testinglib" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing Library on Twitter</a><a class="hash-link" href="#testing-library-on-twitter" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>A lot of chatter is going on in the Testing Library world on Twitter, so we've
created a twitter account you can follow and keep up with what's going on.</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/testinglib" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Follow @TestingLib</a></p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="testing-library-on-spectrum"><a href="https://spectrum.chat/testing-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing Library on Spectrum</a><a class="hash-link" href="#testing-library-on-spectrum" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>We've had a pretty active spectrum community for react-testing-library. We're in
the process of moving that to a more general Testing Library spectrum so we can
have all discussion around the different wrappers in one place. There are over
600 members of our spectrum community (special shout-out to
<a href="https://spectrum.chat/users/gpx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giorgio</a> who has been SUPER helpful to people
there.) Please join us!</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://spectrum.chat/testing-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Join us on Spectrum</a></p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="testing-library-on-react-native"><a href="https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing Library on React Native</a><a class="hash-link" href="#testing-library-on-react-native" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I'm really happy to announce a super solution to the React Native testing space.
The DOM is quite different from native, as I mentioned before, it's not the code
but the concepts that really make the Testing Library great. I'm happy to say
that <a href="https://github.com/bcarroll22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brandon Carroll</a> has successfully ported
those concepts to a solution for React Native and I'm really happy with it. Give
it a look if you're building React Native applications and want confidence that
they continue to work as you make changes!</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Checkout native-testing-library</a></p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="learn-testing-library"><a href="/docs/learning">Learn Testing Library</a><a class="hash-link" href="#learn-testing-library" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>There's been a LOT of activity around the Testing Library principles and tools
in the content space. We do have
<a href="/docs/learning">a page that lists learning materials</a>, and more gets added to
it daily. If you know of blog posts, YouTube videos, courses, or anything else
about the Testing Library family of tools, please contribute to the list!</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://github.com/testing-library/testing-library-docs/edit/main/docs/learning.mdx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contribute to the learning materials page</a></p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="other-exciting-news">Other Exciting news<a class="hash-link" href="#other-exciting-news" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As of a few months ago,
<a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the React team officially recommends</a>
you use react-testing-library to test your react applications. That's kinda neat
:)</p><p>At the React Amsterdam <a href="https://osawards.com/react/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Source awards</a>
ceremony, react-testing-library won the award for the Most impactful
contribution to the community!</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Open Source Awards award" src="/assets/images/award-4ab55893b6382919b43dff3db505287a.jpg" width="693" height="900" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>react-testing-library <em>also</em> received recognition on the
<a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ThoughtWorks Technology Radar</a>
as technology they believe is "Worth exploring with the goal of understanding
how it will affect your enterprise." We think so too :)</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="special-thank-you">Special Thank You<a class="hash-link" href="#special-thank-you" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Each of the projects has had many contributors and on most projects in
<a href="https://github.com/testing-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the org</a>, you'll find a table of
contributors. We're super grateful for all the contributions people have made to
the projects. I'd like to also give a special shout-out to people who have made
an especially significant impact on the Testing Library family of tools and
community.</p><p><a href="https://kentcdodds.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Myself 👋</a>, <a href="https://alexkrolick.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex Krolick</a>,

especially great work. Thank you!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>No matter what platform you're working with, the guiding principles of the
Testing Library family can be applied to the tests for that platform. Take a
step back and consider how closely your tests are resembling the way your
software is used. If you can, consider what lightweight but powerful utilities
would enable others to test their software in that way as well and create a
library for that! Maybe it can join the Testing Library family of tools!</p>]]></content:encoded>
